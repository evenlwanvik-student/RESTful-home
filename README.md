# RESTful-home

Home automation project using REST services on Raspberry Pi. This is mainly supposed to be learning opportunity to better my understanding of both programming languages and the interoperability of an automated system.

## Github workflow

I will be using [a successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by Vincent Driessen:

* A `master` branch, used only for release.
* A `develop` branch off of the master branch. That's the one that will be used for most main-line work.
* multiple `feature` branches, whose name is based on the feature, will sprout of the develop branch.
* A `release` branch to hold the deployed software, with only bug fixes and no new features.
